Predicting the Geothermal Reservoir Temperatures with Hydrogeochemical Aspect by Using Machine Learning Algorithms 

In this study,  machine learning technique try to apply prediction of geothermal reservoir temperatures based on hydrogeochemistry data. A comparative study of an existing set of machine learning algorithms has been performed and both regression and classification approaches are used in this study. In the regression approach, the geothermal reservoir temperatures have been predicted as a numerical value. 

In the classification approach, we defined three main categories for the geothermal reservoir temperatures to  classify our data: Low (20-40 °C), medium (40-60 °C) and high (> 60 °C). The results have been obtained as categories and the models have been compared with their accuracy in this study.

For regression approach, Linear Regression and Linear SVM models have been used. You can run these models. (ResTempReg.m)

For classification approach, traditional machine learning classifiers (SVM and KNN) and advanced machine learning classifier (RNN) have been used. You can run these models. (ResTempClass.m)
